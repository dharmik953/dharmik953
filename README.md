# 🧠 Enterprise Generative AI Architect | RAG Systems | Governance-First AI | AWS

Designing production-grade AI systems for regulated, high-scale environments where **accuracy, traceability, and performance are non-negotiable**.

## 👋 Professional Summary

AI/ML Engineer specializing in **Enterprise Generative AI systems**, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and scalable LLM deployment on AWS.

My work focuses on building **governed, audit-ready AI platforms** rather than isolated models. I design multi-tenant architectures, hybrid retrieval systems, fine-tuned LLM pipelines, and compliance-aligned AI systems capable of operating under strict regulatory and operational constraints.

I operate at the intersection of:

- Generative AI architecture  
- Retrieval intelligence  
- Model governance  
- Scalable cloud deployment  
- Cost-optimized fine-tuning  

I build AI systems that organizations can trust, scale, and defend.

# 🏗 Enterprise Generative AI Architecture Expertise

I design production-grade RAG platforms capable of operating in **regulated financial environments** with:

- 1M+ document ingestion per day
- 40K+ real-time queries per day
- 2–4 second latency SLA
- Multi-tenant isolation
- Hybrid LLM (self-hosted + managed fallback)
- Human-in-the-loop gating
- Full audit reconstruction

### Architecture Layers I Design:

- Presentation Layer (RBAC + tenant isolation)
- API Gateway + WAF security layer
- Agent Orchestration (query classification, HITL gates)
- Hybrid Retrieval Layer (vector + keyword with dynamic weighting)
- LLM Layer (fine-tuned + fallback strategy)
- Governance & Observability Layer (drift, hallucination, audit logs)

This is systems engineering—not prompt engineering.

- Achieved token reduction of ~25–30% through context optimization

---

## 2️⃣ Cost-Optimized LLM Fine-Tuning Framework

Implemented LoRA / QLoRA adaptation pipelines to improve domain alignment.

**Impact:**
- Reduced GPU memory usage significantly
- Cut fine-tuning costs by over 50%
- Improved domain-specific response accuracy by ~15%
- Enabled rapid experimentation cycles using MLflow tracking

---

## 3️⃣ Scalable ML Analytics Platform

Migrated single-node data pipelines to distributed Spark architecture.

**Impact:**
- Reduced data processing time from hours to under 40 minutes
- Improved analytics delivery efficiency by ~40%
- Enabled faster model iteration and deployment cycles

# ⚙️ System Design & Production Capabilities

I design systems with:

- Blue/Green & Canary deployment strategies
- Circuit breaker fallback logic for LLM overload
- Retrieval recall monitoring (Recall@K, MRR)
- Embedding & query distribution drift detection
- Immutable audit logs (S3 + lifecycle policies)
- Confidence-based response gating
- Context sufficiency validation before generation

Focus: **resilience, explainability, and operational stability.**

# 🛡 AI Governance & Compliance Focus

I build AI systems that align with:

- SOC2 control expectations
- Model Risk Management (MRM) practices
- Audit reconstruction requirements
- Data privacy & PII masking pipelines
- Cross-tenant isolation enforcement

# 💰 Cost Optimization & Performance Engineering

Performance engineering is built into architecture decisions.

Implemented:

- Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (LoRA / QLoRA)
- Context compression & token reduction strategies
- Retrieval pre-validation before generation
- Adaptive chunk sizing
- Flash Attention integration
- Hybrid LLM fallback to control API dependency costs
